2. **Self-Attention with Sentences**
   - Application of self-attention to natural language
   - Word-level attention patterns
   - Visualization of attention weights in sentence context

3. **Word Embeddings**
   - Implementation of word embeddings
   - Integration with positional encoding
   - Visualization of embedding spaces

4. **Parameter Variations**
   - Experimentation with different model parameters
